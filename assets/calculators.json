It is the percentage of the principal amount that is paid as an interest for the specified period by the borrower to the lender. Simple interest is generally applied over a time period other than a year, e.g., a month. Simple interest is calculated by multiplying the interest rate by the principal by the number of periods. Where, Interest = Principal * Rate of Interest * Time Period"

                "fullDescription": "Compound Interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan. Compound interest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a deposit or loan grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is interest calculated only on the principal amount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of compounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100 compounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5% semi-annually over the same time period."

Annuities are created and sold by financial institutions, which accept and invest funds from individuals. Upon annuitization, the holding institution will issue a stream of payments at a later point in time. The period of time when an annuity is being funded and before payouts begin is referred to as the accumulation phase. Once payments commence, the contract is in the annuitization phase."
